                  <h3>Don't Panic!</h3>
                  <p>When you start programming, everything is new. You can't possibly remember everything at once. That's what cheatsheets are for. And Google. And forums. Find what you need and type it. Eventually, after typing the same thing several times, you won't need to look it up anymore.</p>

                <div id="advice-left-bottom">
                  <h3>Just roll with it.</h3>
                  <p>At first it's not really clear what's happening, or why things work the way they do. Just roll with it. Eventually it will make sense. It's kind of like "fake it till you make it," except you're only tricking your own brain. Into learning! Sneaky!</p>

                <h3>Keep at it, but practice self care.</h3>
                <p>It will really help if you can spend some time every day coding so your brain can really learn. Make sure to take breaks when you're getting tired, drink enough water (stay hydrated!), eat a snack when you need to, and go for a little walk to stretch your muscles and get some fresh air. Just come back to coding when you can. Try not to take more than one day off unless you absolutely have to.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But be kind to yourself. If you're in horrible pain because you've broken your arm, or your brain just refuses to work because your mom just died, take a week or however much time you need. Let your body and mind start to heal. Then come back.</p>
